# Changelog

## [0.3] - 2018-XX-YY

### Added
- Now signal scaling does not depend on the basecalling. This enables
  demultiplexing of reads that fail to be processed by a basecaller.
- Shows detailed error messages in `poreplex.log`.
- Improved neural network model for barcode demultiplexing with better
  accuracy and quality control.
- The files generated by `--dump-basecalled-events` now includes
  the attributes for signal scaling parameters and the last position
  that DNA adapter ends within the signal.

### Changed
- Fixed an error that stops overall process by an invalid FAST5 file.
- Fixed a problem that separate lines of FASTA, FASTQ or
  `sequencing-summary.txt` are mixed up in the output file sometimes.

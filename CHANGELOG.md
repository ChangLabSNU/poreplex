# Changelog

## [0.3] - 2018-XX-YY

### Added
- Now signal scaling does not depend on the basecalling. This enables
  demultiplexing of reads that fail to be processed by a basecaller.
- Shows detailed error messages in `poreplex.log`.
- The files generated by `--dump-basecalled-events` now includes
  the attributes for signal scaling parameters and the last position
  that DNA adapter ends within the signal.
- Extremely short sequences are now sorted into `fail`ed reads.
  The minimum required length can be changed with the
  `--minimum-length` switch. (Suggested by Nathan Roach)

### Changed
- Fixed an error that stops overall process by an invalid FAST5 file.
- Fixed a problem that separate lines of FASTA, FASTQ or
  `sequencing-summary.txt` are mixed up in the output file sometimes.
- Updated the neural network model for barcode demultiplexing for
  even less false positives using randomly stitched signal fragments
  as a background.
